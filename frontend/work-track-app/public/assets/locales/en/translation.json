I actively participate in the sports community as an arbiter, making correct decisions on the field and contributing to the sportsmanship of the game. Through this role, I develop my decision-making, fairness, and teamwork skills. Beyond academic and sports spheres, I enjoy exploring new technologies and keeping up with the latest trends in information technology.
